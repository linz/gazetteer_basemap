LINZ gazetteer application basemap

This is a tilemill project for creating the basemap for the LINZ (Land Information New Zealand) 
gazetteer basemap.  

Prerequisites:
=============

This project has been built on Ubuntu 12.04 (precise).  The sources.list contains the following
repositories.

deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable/ubuntu precise main
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable/ubuntu precise main

Packages used include:
tilemill
imagemagick
gdal-bin
python-gdal
python-numpy
mapnik-utils
geotiff-bin


Build instructions:
===================

The python script build_project.py sets up the data files and tile mill project file for the
basemap.  It uses the following components:

build_project.py: the main script
build_project.cfg: the configuration file - a JSON formatted file (see build_project.py source for more details)
layers.cfg: A list of layers (see build_project.py source for more details)

The configuration file currently assumes that the source topo data are held in shape files in the 
following locations:

/usr/local/data/topo50
/usr/local/data/topo250
/usr/local/data/topo250_relief (hill shading images 01_hs.tif to 30_hs.tif)
/usr/local/data/topo500

All files are in NZTM projection

The build_project.py script builds converted versions of the files it requires in the filecache
folder, and sets up a project.mml file using them. 

This can be changed by altering the build_project.cfg file or creating a separate configuration file
that overrides the appropriate parts of it.

The resulting project file can be opened in tilemill and used to generate the basemap, 
or exported using the command below in the base directory (assuming the project is in the 
gazetteer_basemap directory

/usr/share/tilemill/index.js export --format=mbtiles gazetteer_basemap gazetteer_basemap.mbtiles

Other components
================

The two other scripts used in building the data files are:

makepoly.py:  This takes a coastline linestring shape file file and composes a tiled set of polygons
covering the island.  The tiling is done partly to improve rendering times, partly it just seemed a good
idea at the time.

prepare_hstif.sh: A script to generate the hill shading rasters.  This is not working yet :-(

Styling notes
============

The stylesheets (.mss) use class selectors comprehensively.  The current behaviour of CartoCSS is 
a little obscure, in that

.class1
{
   .class2
   {
       Styling instructions
   }
}

doesn't work, but

.class1
{
   .class2[zoom>4]
   {
       Styling instructions
   }
}

does?  I haven't followed up on this.


To be done
=========

1) Hill shading

The hill shading is not working.  I was trying to generate a black image with hillshading encoded in an
alpha channel, but haven't managed to do this yet - I think I haven't been able to generate the correct
bit depth in the image.  Basically just needs fixing prepare_hstif.sh and then uncommenting the hill
shading from layer.cfg.  Possibly a bit of work in styling too...

2) Review the topo shape files to confirm that there are no others that should be rendered.

3) Replace the blank sea with a relief shaded or similar background.
