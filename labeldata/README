This directory contains the files required to build the data used for WFS map labels service
used by the gazetteer basemap.  The scripts assume a PostGis enabled postgresql database 
that can be used to generate the data, and from which the table is dumped ready for upload 
into the LINZ data service.  Also it assumes that the geographic_name.shp files from the 
NZ Topo50 database are available for building the layers from.

prepdata.sh builds the labels required for the WFS layer.

loadcodes.sh can be used to add an additional table of point code descriptions to
   help analyze the data.
